# Luyencode Solutions

This repository contains code samples and problem solutions sourced from [Luyencode](https://luyencode.net/).  Each solution is stored as a single file and many problems include implementations in multiple languages.

## Directory overview

The repository is flat with each file named after the problem ID.  For instance `cb01.cpp`, `cb01.java`, and `cb01.py` are solutions for the same problem written in C++, Java, and Python respectively.

Languages represented in the repository include:

- C/C++ (`.cpp`)
- Java (`.java`)
- C# (`.cs`)
- Python (`.py`)
- PHP (`.php`)
- Ruby (`.rb`)

Other languages may also appear depending on the problem.

## Running the solutions

Each program reads input from standard input and writes the result to standard output.  The examples below assume you have the required compiler or interpreter installed.

### C/C++
```bash
# Compile
g++ cb01.cpp -o cb01
# Execute
./cb01 < input.txt
```

### Java
```bash
# Compile
javac cb01.java
# Execute
java cb01 < input.txt
```

### Python
```bash
python3 cb01.py < input.txt
```

### PHP
```bash
php cb01.php < input.txt
```

### C# (Mono)
```bash
# Compile
mcs cb01.cs
# Execute
mono cb01.exe < input.txt
```

### Ruby
```bash
ruby cb01.rb < input.txt
```

Each source file can be compiled or executed in the same manner by replacing `cb01` with the appropriate problem identifier.
